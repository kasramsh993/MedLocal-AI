This document is the **high-level “what to do next”** companion to GitHub issues and boards. It is updated when the codebase or priorities change.

## Assessment — 2026-05-26

### Summary

MedLocal AI is **reasonably organized for a Streamlit PoC**, not a chaotic prototype. Folder layout by domain (`components/`, `generation/`, `billing/`, `coding/`, etc.) is sound. The main gaps are **repository hygiene**, **dead code from iterative Codex development**, and **documentation** (now being addressed).

### Organization scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Folder structure | 8/10 | Sensible domain split |
| Separation of concerns | 6/10 | Good modules; `app.py` still orchestrates too much |
| Dead code | 4/10 | Unused imports and orphan modules |
| Repo cleanliness | 3/10 → improving | DB, PDFs, venv were in tree; `.gitignore` added |
| In-repo documentation | 5/10 → improving | Strong root README; `docs/` added |
| Testability | 5/10 | Scripts only, no `tests/` package |

### What is working well

- Clear entry point: `streamlit run app.py`
- UI separated into `components/`
- Report pipeline: extract → schema → render → guard → PDF/DB
- Local-first stack: Whisper, Ollama, SQLite
- i18n (Deutsch / English) for UI strings
- Validation scripts under `scripts/`

### What needs attention (priority order)

#### P0 — Done in this session

- [x] `.gitignore` for venv, `data/medlocal.db`, `exports/reports/*.pdf`, `_freeze/`, `__pycache__`
- [x] `docs/` structure and master [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)
- [x] Git repository initialized; first commit scoped to docs + gitignore

#### P1 — Next (no behavior change)

- [ ] Connect GitHub remote and push `main`
- [ ] Verify ignored files are not staged (`git status` clean except source)
- [ ] Remove `_freeze/` from day-to-day workflow (keep backups outside repo if needed)

#### P2 — Code cleanup (small, safe PRs)

- [ ] Remove unused imports in `app.py` (never called: `build_generation_context`, `build_insurance_ready_fallback_report`, `build_system_prompt`, `build_user_prompt`, `clean_final_report_text`)
- [ ] Remove `_report_is_bad()` (defined, never called)
- [ ] Retire or reconnect: `generation/context_builder.py`, `generation/fallback_report.py`, `templates/prompts.py` (superseded by inline JSON prompt in `app.py`)
- [ ] Remove unused `utils/report_cleaning.py` after consolidating with `validation/final_report_guard.py`
- [ ] Trim `utils/medical_codes.py` to `SPECIALTY_ICONS` only (legacy `suggest_codes` unused)

#### P3 — Structure (optional refactor)

- [ ] Extract generation workflow from `app.py`
- [ ] Externalize CSS from `theme/theme.py`
- [ ] Provider lists → `data/providers.json`
- [ ] Pin dependency versions in `requirements.txt`

#### P4 — Quality

- [ ] `tests/` with pytest
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` for Cursor/Codex
- [ ] CI running validation scripts

### Dead code reference (for P2)

| Symbol / file | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| `app.py` imports listed above | Imported, not called |
| `_report_is_bad()` | Defined in `app.py`, not called |
| `context_builder.py` | Orphaned |
| `fallback_report.py` | Orphaned |
| `templates/prompts.py` | Replaced by inline JSON extraction prompt |
| `report_cleaning.py` | Duplicates guard logic; unused |
| `medical_codes.suggest_codes` | Replaced by `icd10_search` + `billing_optimizer` |

### Duplicate logic

Report sanitization exists in both `utils/report_cleaning.py` and `validation/final_report_guard.py`. Only the guard is used in the live path — merge into one implementation.

## Immediate next actions (after docs commit)

1. **You:** `git remote add origin <your-github-url>` then `git push -u origin main`
2. **Next PR:** Phase 2 dead-code removal (see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md))
3. **Ongoing:** Log completed work in [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md); log failed experiments in [FAILED_ATTEMPTS.md](FAILED_ATTEMPTS.md)
